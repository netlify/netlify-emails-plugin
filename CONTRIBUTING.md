1. Disable the email plugin, via the UI, for the site that is linked to your project
2. Enable the plugin, via the `netlify.toml` file, adding the following:
   ```
   [[plugins]]
       package = "../path/to/local/package"
   ```
3. Remove all node_modules and delete all contents within your `.netlify` folder, except for `state.json`
4. Add all of your dependencies again with `yarn install` and run `netlify build && netlify dev`
